        "This wireless keyboard has excellent build quality and aesthetics. Its double gasket-mounted design offers a softer, springy typing experience compared to most prebuilt mechanical keyboards.nA key feature is its hardware customizability. With a hot-swappable PCB, you can easily change the switches. Other parts, like stabilizers and keycaps, are also replaceable, with a toolkit included for disassembly. While the Q5 Max is recommended for programmers, the entire Keychron Q Max Series is worth exploring for its variety of sizes and layouts.",

        "The NuPhy Air75 V2 is one of the best wireless mechanical keyboards for programming at a mid-range price. Though not always in stock online, it's available on Nuphy's website. It offers an excellent typing experience, great build quality, and is lightweight, portable, and versatile. It supports VIA software for customizing backlighting, key assignments, layers, macros, and more via any Chromium-based browser. With low-profile mechanical switches and chiclet-style keycaps, it's comfortable for long use. The durable PBT keycaps have a pleasant texture, and the impressive battery life reduces charging frequency. It's also available in two other sizes: the compact NuPhy Air60 V2 and the larger NuPhy Air96 V2.",

        "For a less expensive wireless option, the Keychron V5 Max is hard to beat. It's a budget-friendly version of the Keychron Q5 Max and can be found on Keychron's website. Though it lacks the solid aluminum frame of the Q Max series, it has a sturdy plastic frame, PBT keycaps, screw-in stabilizers, and sound-dampening foam to reduce typing noise.Like the Q5 Max, it offers full customizability, from hardware components to firmware, making it an excellent starting point for a bespoke programming keyboard. The V5 Max and other sizes in the V Max series are easy to deconstruct with the included toolkit, taking about an hour to swap components.",

        "We recommend the ROYAL KLUDGE RK61 if you need a cheap, dependable, wireless coding keyboard. It's compact and portable but lacks a dedicated function row and arrow keys, which might be a dealbreaker if you rely on these. The RK61 has a hot-swappable PCB for easy switch replacement and can connect to three devices simultaneously via Bluetooth. There's also a variant with a wireless USB receiver, useful in noisy Bluetooth environments. However, the battery life is limited to around 10 hours. It includes a USB-A to USB-C cable, allowing use while charging. Variants include options with Bluetooth only and single-color backlighting or a USB receiver and RGB backlighting.",

The dish-shaped keycaps help minimize typos, and it offers excellent wireless versatility, connecting via USB receiver or Bluetooth to up to three devices.
